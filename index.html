	<h2>Charles Wallace India Trust Scholarships</h2>

	<p>CWIT enables Indians in the early to mid stages of their careers to spend time in the UK, helping them to achieve artistic, academic and professional ambitions and to broaden their international contacts.
		<br>
		Who was Charles Wallace?
		<br>
		Charles Wallace was born in Calcutta in 1855. He lived, worked and flourished there, founding the Shaw Wallace company (though there are no connections now between CWIT and Shaw Wallace).
		<br>
		Charles Wallace died in 1916, bequeathing his modest fortune to his family for a generation and then for the benefit of those among whom he had made it.
		<br>
		About CWIT
		In 1981, following an agreement between the Indian and British governments, CWIT was established as an English charity. It is run by four trustees. The trustees cover CWIT’s main areas of interest and are Dr Yasmin Khan, Caroline Douglas,Gregor Stark, and Cathy Stephens. The Secretary is Shreela Ghosh. 
		<br>
		In over 30 years CWIT has made around 2700 grants. British Council India advises on CWIT’s work and gives valuable administrative support.
		<br>
		CWIT’s recent annual reports and accounts, including lists of scholarships and grants given, can be seen on the Charity Commission’s website
		<br>
		Please note: The London School of Performing Arts (LISPA) has now moved its courses to Berlin hence CWIT will no longer offer scholarships to attend them. We have agreed to reconsider if LISPA move their course back to London.
		<br>
		Visas <br>
		While the British Council will facilitate and advise, the cost of the visa must be borne by the applicant.
